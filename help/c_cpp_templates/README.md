# Technology Stack and Structure
The code / templates follow an object-oriented C-style approach, where each module is realized using a **`*.c/*.cpp`** and **`*.h`** file. The **`*.c/*.cpp`** file contains a static structure with the module's variables, while the functions act as member functions (similar to object-oriented methods).

Furthermore, the additional files and templates serve as structural guidelines to ensure the code remains readable, well-organized, and maintainable.
